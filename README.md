# Red-Black-Tree-Implementation
Repository contains a C++ implementation of a Red-Black Tree, a self-balancing binary search tree with efficient insertions, deletions, and lookups. The Red-Black Tree data structure maintains balance by ensuring that the tree height remains logarithmic, guaranteeing efficient operations even in the worst-case scenarios.
